HITESH BHATNAGAR

SUMMARY
Final-year ECE student at VIT with interdisciplinary expertise in Machine Learning, Embedded Systems, and Software Development.

EXPERIENCE
Research Intern | IIT Goa (Deep Learning & Audio Processing) | May 2025 – Jul 2025
- Engineered a hybrid Deep Learning Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) model (FxEHCAF + SFANC).
- Achieved significant performance gains: MSE = 2.9e-5, SNR = 27.10 dB.
- Optimized model with adaptive learning rates and reduced latency using a lightweight CNN.

KEY PROJECTS
1. PDF Summarizer App (Flutter, OpenAI API): Built a cross-platform app reducing document reading time by 80%.
2. Embedded RTOS Simulator (C, Linux): Architected a deterministic RTOS kernel with preemptive scheduling and IPC.
3. Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Python, ML): Deployed an end-to-end ML pipeline with 80%+ accuracy on Streamlit.

TOP SKILLS
- Languages: Python, C/Embedded C, Java, Dart, SQL.
- Frameworks: Flutter, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn.
- Core Concepts: RTOS, DSA, OOP, Deep Learning, DSP.
